                <p class="labe">Integrated Learning Project, also known as ILP, is a learning process or method that
                    combines multiple different subjects into one big project. This system is required for all 9th-grade
                    students in Santa Ursula Junior High School throughout the academic year. For this semester, 6
                    different groups were assigned to create and plan a bazaar, with each group consisting of 6 people.
                    Different themes, names, and designs for each booth were chosen by us, as well as everything
                    included in our stall, such as products and promotions. Through this whole process of the
                    researchers’ bazaar project, we managed to learn many important skills such as critical thinking,
                    problem-solving, and teamwork, which will be helpful to overcome future challenges and future
                    careers. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p class="labe">The first step to prepare our bazaar was to think of a name and logo. Java Jaws was the
                    name chosen by our group. Java Jaws consists of two words, one of which is "Java" which was taken
                    from the theme of the bazaar, namely Javanese culture. "Jaws" was taken from our leopard mascot, an
                    animal endemic to Java which has the character of courage and integrity. Our leopard mascot was also
                    named Rana, a name that means bravery and courage. After we came up with a solid identity for our
                    booth, we started planning out what we were going to sell. A total of 9 products were sold by us,
                    some made according to the instructions of specific subjects’ assignments. Our products consisted of
                    an aquarium water ring toss toy, chicken popcorn, sticker sheets of our design, perfume as their
                    biotechnology product, a traditional Javanese drink called wedang uwuh, kue cubit, tote bags using
                    our own as well, and a syrup with sprite drink. This was the specific menu chosen by us because we
                    felt that it would be interesting to our customers and fun to make. Our products were then promoted
                    by us through social media platforms using engaging posts and videos leading up to the day of the
                    bazaar. On the day of the bazaar, all of our products were sold out thankfully, but our totebag
                    performed slightly slower than the other products.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p class="labe">One of the challenges that had to be faced throughout the preparation process was
                    finding the right time to complete all our tasks. It was difficult to match up all our schedules to
                    meet up or prepare the products together because everyone was always busy with other activities of
                    their own, so most times we could not meet up all together outside of school hours. Because of this
                    complication, any meetups together had to be planned a week or more before the deadline to ensure
                    everyone was available. Thankfully, since me and my group spent lots of time together, we eventually
                    cleared up that problem by working together and communicating a lot. Other than that, another
                    challenge we faced was adapting to all the new applications and programs we had to use to complete
                    assignments such as CSS and creating many detailed reports because sometimes it was complicated to
                    find the information and data for those things and it would take up lots of time. We eventually did
                    get used to it however, by asking for help from our teachers or to each other. </p>

                <p class="labe">In conclusion, ILP gave us an unforgettable experience through this bazaar project. We
                    managed to learn many new things such as critical thinking, entrepreneurship, financial management,
                    and more importantly, how to cooperate and communicate as a team. Lots of reports and data tables
                    had to be made, but all challenges were eventually overcome as a team, which I think is a skill that
                    will be very beneficial in the future.</p>
